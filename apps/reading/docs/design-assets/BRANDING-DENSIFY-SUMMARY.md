## Product surfaces now UI-consuming session brand

| Surface | Asset | testid |
|---|---|---|
| Werner moods thinking/celebrate | session PNGs | via brand/Werner.tsx |
| ArcadeCabinet chrome + ice/zombies art | session PNGs | cabinet-brand-* |
| Research wait arcade | session ice/zombies | research-wait-arcade |
| Library Read door | thinking | library-werner-brand |
| Research home | thinking | research-home-werner-brand |
| Write door | celebrate | write-home-werner-brand |
| Settings Antiek-bench | thinking | antiek-bench-werner |
| Login desk | thinking | login-werner-brand |

## Living-TV interaction

- Scenery product map + hover glance (once/hotspot) + sun focus ring
- Product click highlight owned by AppShell map; peak-left ambient owns click highlight
- Cabinet play → highlight; budget over → fail; Midnight Oil arm → deep_research_start
- Arcade: ice fishing, clam catcher, zombies + LoadingGameHost

## Imagine inventory (not product-mapped)

`docs/design-assets/session-20260715/` including clam catcher candidate.

## Pulse

`branding-doors-pulse.log` — 76 tests / 12 files green (2026-07-16).

## Honest gaps still open

- Pure Flipbook sole UI NO-GO
- CF Pages external-pending often
- Operator merge wall on #2416

## Clam Catcher session promote (2026-07-16)

- Invent `session-20260715/werner_clam_catcher_refedit_v1.jpg` →
  `poses/session/werner_clam_catcher_session_v1.png` via `cut_session_fringe.py`
- Opaque provenance retained; four corners alpha=0; cabinet card uses session PNG
- Authored webp key art remains for in-game visual kit (no Werner on sprites)

## Thought-partner desk promote (2026-07-16)

- Invent `session-20260715/werner_thought_partner_desk_refedit_v1.jpg` →
  `poses/session/werner_thought_partner_desk_session_v1.webp` (1200×800, q88)
- Full-bleed scene art (not alpha character mark) on ThoughtPartnerPanel
- CTA emits Werner `highlight` living-TV beat
